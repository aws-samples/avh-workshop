Refrence examples to showcase AWS IoT connectivity using ARM CMSIS packs for FreeRTOS modular libraries running on ARM Virtual Hardware.

## Hardware

Virtual Hardware: AVH Corstone 300

Processor : ARM Cortex M55


## Use Vscode and EC2 Instance with Virtual Hardware

1. Create an EC2 instance containing ARM Corestone 300 Virtual Hardware.
2. Login to the EC2 Instance and clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/avh-workshop.git
```

3. Refer to AWS Workshop for instructions: https://getting-started-with-arm-virtual-hardware.workshop.aws/
